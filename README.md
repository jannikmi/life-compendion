# life compendion

A compendion (= companion + compendium) for life aiming to become THE compendion for life

## Dedication

for my children and all other life

## Meta

This piece of work is being referred to as "opus" (Latin: "piece of work"), as it is not really a book or just a text.

Most chapters are trying to answer questions in life. A little like a "How to" Guide.

Even if the answers cannot be given (yet), just asking the right questions can provide value by focussing ones thinking and actions.

There are auxiliary chapters introducing fundamental concepts relevant in multiple places. 

Some chapters simply point to other sources and concepts as "further reading" reference.

## Disclaimers

- This is all still very much work in progress and probably always will be. 
- Open Source: all kinds of contributions, feedback and pull requests are welcome
- Not all used words and concepts can be defined here. The reader is asked to consult other places for definitions.
- Some of the thoughts here are super basic. Don't be offended if something seems trivial. For others that might not be the case and the downsides of not writing are down is higher.


## Motivation

- Why is it that school is not teaching many concepts fundamental for coping with life?
- Why is it that so many important things in life have to be learned by experience and gaining the necessary experience is not guaranteed?
- Why is there no easy way of sharing and accessing all insights, thoughts and ideas which are too important to take the risk of anyone not knowing about?

This opus is about filling the gap. 


## What ought to be done?

This is perhaps the superlative of questions.
It's asking for normativity, the absolute good and thereby gives (our) life a goal/direction to strive towards.

Currently, this is still an open question.

The partial answer given here:
- we must acknowledge how far we are from a satisfying answer
- we should not accept unverifiable answers, like "everyone gets to choose the meaning of their own life"
- you should keep looking for the answer
- all intelligence should collaborate to find the answer
- we should strengthen scientific progress and everything that indirectly supports scientific progress
- we should not search in any way, but try to find and use the most efficient way

The remainder of this opus aids in navigating the inevitable challenges of life and thereby also helps to focus energy towards finding normativity.



## What are the most significant questions in life?

This is basically the question of what this opus should contain.

As the familiarization with our own life might clouds our thinking, lets use the bottom up thinking strategy to help compiling a list of the most relevant questions.

Let's consider the case where you suddenly got the task to take care of a new life, a being.

Obviously there are many practical tasks you directly or indirectly need to handle for the being.
So the first question is: 

- What knowledge is helpful for the practical tasks of life? -> Practical Knowledge


As the being probably has a complex physical form, keeping this form healthy is vital for the length and quality life.

- How to live healthy?
- How to take care of ones psychological health? (stress, relaxation, yoga, mediation...)


There are many things you need to teach the little one to be independent:
- How to educate?


Not all tasks will be known in advance and it won't be possible to learn everything "by heart". We need to teach more abstract skills.

- What skills are important in life and how can they be obtained?
- What medical knowledge is helpful to make healthy decisions?
- How can problems in general be solved efficiently?
- Which biases does the human brain have and how to avoid them?


Everyone seems to have a different opinions: relatives, friends, doctors, media, this opus, ...

- How to get to the truth?


In many cases, decisions in life are not binary, but possible actions rather come in a spectrum. 

- How to strike the right balance?


The being probably has instincts and emotions:

- How to balance rationality with emotions?


As the being interactions with other beings, new questions arise:

- How can we collaborate efficiently?
- What is there to know about friendship?
- How to pick a partner?


The being at one point will have to complete tasks.

- How to learn efficiently?
- How to work efficiently?
- How to prioritise things?


Optimising oneself and the immediate surroundings (local) has limitations.
A reference to game theory: the individual can be seen as a player in a game with rules. 
When the rules are fixed the individual player can optimise the outcome by understanding the game/rules and choosing the optimal actions.
In the game of life not all but many rules (society, economy) are man-made and can be challenged.
So the optimisation problem becomes even more complex, because possible actions include changing the rules of life.

- How should the world be for an ideal life?
- How can we improve the world towards the ideal?
- How to design robust systems?
- How much time should one spend in changing the existing system? 
- How to balance holistic (altruistic) vs. atomistic (egoistic) actions? By giving yourself up easily, no one benefits. 


## How to strike the right balance?

- Equilibrium, Balance
- Stability
- Robustness

## Problem Solving Strategies

- top down: If a problem is too big to tackle, break it down recursively until the sub-problems become manageable. Make sure to stop early to avoid getting lost in the details.
- bottom up: When things are too complex (too many parts and interactions cloud a solution), start from scratch and one by one add only the most essential parts until progress is possible. Continue of if becomes obvious that parts are missing. This avoids setting the scope to include unneccesary 
- don't reinvent the wheel: search for existing solutions and use them as inspiration or baseline, reuse.

## Wisdom in quotes

“Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future, and renders the present inaccessible.” – Maya Angelou

“Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.” – Colin Powell
