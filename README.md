# life compendion

A compendion (= companion + compendium) for life aiming to become THE compendion for life

## Dedication

for my children and all other life

## Meta

This piece of work is being referred to as "opus" (Latin: "piece of work"), as it is not really a book or just a text.

Most chapters are trying to answer questions in life.

There are auxiliary chapters introducing fundamental concepts relevant in multiple places.

Some chapters simply point to other sources and concepts as "further reading" reference.

## Disclaimers

- This is all still very much work in progress and probably always will be. 
- Open Source: all kinds of contributions, feedback and pull requests are welcome
- Not all used words and concepts can be defined here. The reader is asked to consult other places for definitions.
- Some of the thoughts here are super basic. Don't be offended if something seems trivial. For others that might not be the case and the downsides of not writing are down is higher.


## Motivation

- Why is it that school is not teaching many concepts fundamental for coping with life?
- Why is it that so many important things in life have to be learned by experience and gaining the necessary experience is not guaranteed?
- Why is there no easy way of sharing and accessing all insights, thoughts and ideas which are too important to take the risk of anyone not knowing about?

This opus is about filling the gap. 


## What to do?

This is perhaps the superlative of questions.
It's asking for normativity, the absolute good, the meaning of life or what ought to be done.

Currently, this is still an open question.

The partial answer given here:
- we must acknowledge how far we are from a satisfying answer
- we should not accept unverifiable answers, like "everyone gets to choose the meaning of their own life"
- you should keep looking for the answer
- all intelligence should collaborate to find the answer
- we should strengthen scientific progress and everything that indirectly supports scientific progress
- we should not search in any way, but try to find and use the most efficient way

The remainder of this opus aids in navigating the inevitable challenges of life and thereby also helps to focus energy towards finding normativity.

## Problem Solving Strategies

### Top Down

If a problem is too big to tackle, break it down recursively until the sub-problems become manageable.
Make sure to stop early to avoid getting lost in the details.

### Bottom Up

When things are too complex (too many parts and interactions cloud a solution), start from scratch and one by one add only the most essential parts until progress is possible.
