# life compendion

A compendion (= companion + compendium) for life aiming to become THE compendion for life

## Dedication

for my children and all other life

## Meta

This piece of work is being referred to as "opus" (Latin: "piece of work"), as it is not really a book or just a text.

Most chapters are trying to answer questions in life. A little like a "How to" Guide.

Even if the answers are not or cannot be given (yet), just asking the right questions can provide value by focussing ones thinking and actions.

There are auxiliary chapters introducing fundamental concepts relevant in multiple places. 

Some chapters simply point to other sources and concepts as "further reading" reference.


## Disclaimers

- This is all still very much work in progress and probably always will be. 
- Open Source: all kinds of contributions, feedback and pull requests are welcome
- Not all used words and concepts can be defined here. The reader is asked to consult other places for definitions.
- Some of the thoughts here are super basic. Don't be offended if something seems trivial. For others that might not be the case and the downsides of not writing are down is higher.


## Motivation

- Why is it that school is not teaching many concepts fundamental for coping with life?
- Why is it that so many important things in life have to be learned by experience and gaining the necessary experience is not guaranteed?
- Why is there no easy way of sharing and accessing all insights, thoughts and ideas which are too important to take the risk of anyone not knowing about?

This opus is about filling the gap. 


## tl;dr / Summary / Excerpt

- realise: everything is connected. nothing comes for free & everything comes with something!
- understand yourself as a self optimising system and try to improve it
- stay curious: there is more to learn (exploration)
- stay critical: there are things you should change (exploitation)
- try to identify and hit the !right! sweet spot balance in everything you do
- it's a process. trial & error
- do not take anything for granted + be grateful
- relax: trying the best you can is the best you can do and thereby also enough!

## What ought to be done?

This is perhaps the superlative of questions.
It's asking for normativity, the absolute good and thereby gives (our) life a goal/direction to strive towards.

Currently, this is still an open question.

The partial answer given here:
- we must acknowledge how far we are from a satisfying answer
- we should not accept unverifiable answers, like "everyone gets to choose the meaning of their own life"
- you should keep looking for the answer
- all intelligence should collaborate to find the answer
- we should strengthen scientific progress and everything that indirectly supports scientific progress
- we should not search in any way, but try to find and use the most efficient way

The remainder of this opus aids in navigating the inevitable challenges of life and thereby also helps to focus energy towards finding normativity.



## What are the most significant questions in life?


This is basically the question of what this opus should contain.

As the familiarization with our own life might cloud our thinking, lets use the bottom up thinking strategy to help compiling a list of the most relevant questions.

Let's consider the case where you suddenly got the task to take care of a new life, a being.

How do you want to raise that being? What is your goal for that being if you wanted only the best for it?

- What ideals should one thrive towards? 

Obviously there are many practical tasks you directly or indirectly need to handle for the being.

- What knowledge is helpful for the practical tasks of life? -> Practical Knowledge


As the being probably has a complex physical form, keeping this form healthy is vital for the length and quality life.

- How to live healthy?
- How to take care of ones psychological health? (stress, relaxation, yoga, mediation...)


There are many things you need to teach the little one to be independent:
- How to educate?
- How to learn efficiently?

Not all tasks will be known in advance, and it won't be possible to learn everything "by heart". We need to teach more abstract skills.

- What skills are important in life and how can they be obtained?
- What medical knowledge is helpful to make healthy decisions?
- How can problems in general be solved efficiently?
- Which biases does the human brain have and how to avoid them?


Everyone seems to have a different opinions: relatives, friends, doctors, media, this opus, ...

- How to get to the truth?


In many cases, decisions in life are not binary, but possible actions rather come in a spectrum. 

- How to strike the right balance?


The being probably has instincts and emotions:

- How to balance rationality with emotions?


As the being interactions with other beings, new questions arise:

- When is it a good idea to collaborate? When to rather stay individualistic?
- How can we collaborate efficiently?
- What is there to know about friendship?
- How to pick a partner?


The being at one point will have to complete tasks.

- How to learn efficiently?
- How to work efficiently?
- How to prioritise things?


Optimising oneself and the immediate surroundings (local) has limitations.
A reference to game theory: the individual can be seen as a player in a game with rules. 
When the rules are fixed the individual player can optimise the outcome by understanding the game/rules and choosing the optimal actions.
In the game of life not all but many rules (society, economy) are man-made and can be challenged.
So the optimisation problem becomes even more complex, because possible actions include changing the rules of life.

- How should the world be for an ideal life?
- How can we improve the world towards the ideal?
- How to design robust systems?
- How much time should one spend in changing the existing system? 
- How to balance holistic (altruistic) vs. atomistic (egoistic) actions? By giving yourself up easily, no one benefits.


## What ideals should one thrive towards?

- Health: the best possible potential. basis for everything else
- Robustness: stability against all kinds of challenges
- Flexibility: 
- Growth, Learning: improving, expanding the potential. not just for yourself
- Problem Solving


## How to strike the right balance?

- spectrum from extreme to extreme
- Equilibrium. State of balance. 

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesotes

There sometimes are multiple optima along the spectrum!
Example: providence and generosity
Bad extremes: parsimony and profligacy

When to be proactive vs. when to be defensive? Masculine vs. feminine energy.


## How should the world be for an ideal life?

Overall goal:
- maximised research output

Derived goals:
- robustness: the system should be tolerant to flaws and negative effects 
- error correction: self optimising, self correction, auto-healing
- adaptability: the system should adapt easily to new terms and requirements
- sustainability: the system must sustain live on long term
- health: only healthy individuals can be most productive
- non-destructiveness, peace: violence and other forms of destructive actions draw energy from the productive system


3 Divisions like in a Company:
- Operations: keeping the system running. producing food. healing diseases...
- Research and Development: advancing the possibilities. utilising the advances to improve the system.
- Management: optimising the system for the best possible output. setting the terms. 


Questions:
- How to allocate the existing work force?
- How to ideally shape the work force (education, practicing skills...)?
- How to account for the difference between the need of a skill and the preparation time to get it?


## Problem Solving Strategies

- top down: If a problem is too big to tackle, break it down recursively until the sub-problems become manageable. Make sure to stop early to avoid getting lost in the details.
- bottom up: When things are too complex (too many parts and interactions cloud a solution), start from scratch and one by one add only the most essential parts until progress is possible. Continue if it becomes obvious that parts are missing. This avoids setting the scope too broad to include unnecessary parts. 
- don't reinvent the wheel: search for existing solutions and use them as inspiration or baseline, reuse. event if the existing solutions are no full match, they might be good enough point to start from.


## Mental Models


### System Thinking

Input, Control input, Output. 

Complete.


### Concept of Stability

The importance of control and correction mechanisms.
Wherever these measures are missing, inefficiencies and faults evolve.
Example: ministry of statistics. wants to be seen as trustworthy. objections will be discredited. the ministry is not well controlled. the quality of the statistics is at risk.

Importance of encouraging feedback about errors. Error culture. Whistle Blowing!

"No plaintiff, no judge." -> control mechanisms and error correction fail if flaws do not 

Can internal only control mechanisms be sufficient?

Concept: Division of powers

Errors are inevitable. Making mistakes and then correcting them is better than not trying to make any mistakes and hence ending up being stagnant.


## How to get to the truth?


Can something be taken for granted? What can be taken for granted?
Logic, Predicate Logic, ...
Math?

Fuzziness

keep the currently most suitable mental model
[Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor): choose the most simple explanation
stay open-minded, change as soon as necessary

## Practical Knowledge:

## Health

Harmful contaminations: Bacteria, Viruses, toxins, heavy metals, carcinogenic substances...

carcinogenic substances: Mineral oils, plasticizer, microplastics, micro particels, tobacco, alcohol, pesticides (insecticides, herbicides), smoke, dust fumes, curing salt, Estrogen, burnt food (acrylamid)

carcinogenic: UV Radiation, infections with viruses

Washing hands: surfactants must form foam. otherwise the contaminates use up all active parts. use more. respect the recommendations of the WHO and medical professionals

Devices in regular use will accumulate and distribute contamination. Wash them regularly. Examples: mobile phones, keys, laptops, head phones, ...

Avoid contact with devices in regular contact with others (without being cleaned). Examples: Door knobs and public toilets

Dish sponges: moist over long periods of times, promoted microbial growth. change regularly or use alternatives

Brushing teeth: toothpaste is like a surfactants. there must be foam. otherwise contaminates remain on the teeth.

Attention: As with everything: Don't overdo cleanliness! the fear of contamination can become more harmful (unhealthy) than the contamination itself! A fulfilling live will always have a risk of infections. Being educated about the major risk factors for infections is sufficient.

### Nutrition

Sugar. Diabetes.

Eat a lot of fibers. Our gut needs something to "work with".

Eat organic. Less pesticides
Bonus: long term approach, better for the environment. less nitrogen emission. higher social standards, ...

## Wisdom in quotes

“Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future, and renders the present inaccessible.” – Maya Angelou

“Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.” – Colin Powell
