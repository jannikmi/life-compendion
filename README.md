# life compendion

A compendion (= companion + compendium) for life

## Dedication

for my children and all other life

## Meta

This piece of work is being referred to as "opus" (Latin: "piece of work"), as it is not really a book or just a text.

## Disclaimers

- This is all still very much work in progress and probably always will be.
- Open Source: all kinds of contributions, feedback and pull requests are welcome
- Some of the thoughts here are super basic. Don't be offended if something seems trivial. For others it might not be the case and the risk of not writing it down is higher.


## Motivation

- Why is it that school is not teaching many concepts fundamental for coping with life?
- Why is it that so many important things in life have to be learned by experience and gaining the necessary experience is not guaranteed?
- Why is there no easy way of sharing and accessing all insights, thoughts and ideas which are too important to take the risk of anyone not knowing about?

This opus is about filling the gap.
